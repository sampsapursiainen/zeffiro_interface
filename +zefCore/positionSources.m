function [sourcePos, sourceTetI] = positionSources ( nodes, elements, sourceN )
%
% sourcePos = positionSources ( nodes, elements, sourceN )
%
% Places sources evenly into a set of given active elements, returning the
% source positions and which source is in which input element. If there are
% less sources than elements, some elements are skipped and the sources are
% placed only into some. If there are more source than elements, some elements
% will contain multiple sources.
%
% Inputs:
%
% - nodes
%
%   FEM nodes.
%
% - elements
%
%   Indices of nodes ordered in column-major order, meaning a single element is a column of this array.
%
% - sourceN
%
%   The number of requested sources.
%
% Outputs:
%
% - sourcePos
%
%   An Ndim×sourceN array of source positions.
