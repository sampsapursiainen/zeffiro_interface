%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HEADER START %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Do not change or remove this header. This file allows one to add plugins
in the menubar. For each plugin one needs to define, on a single line, its
name, the associated menu label and start command, in the following
comma-delimited format:

PLUGIN_NAME, MENU_LABEL, START_COMMAND

The MENU_LABEL can be one of the following strings: inverse_tools,
forward_tools, multi_tools, project, export, import, edit, window, about.
The plugin will be included in the corresponding menu item with by the
name of PLUGIN_NAME. START_COMMAND is the one which starts the plugin. The
plugin folder should be added in the plugins folder to be included in
Matlab's path.

The list starts after the header.
