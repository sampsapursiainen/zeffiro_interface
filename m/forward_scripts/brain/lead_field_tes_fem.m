%
% Input:
% ------
% - nodes              = N x 3
% - elements           = M x 4
% - sigma              = M x 1 (or M x 6, one row: sigma_11 sigma_22 sigma_33 sigma_12 sigma_13 sigma_23)
% - electrodes         = L x 3
% - brain_ind          = P x 1 (The set of elements that potentially contain source currents, by default contains all elements)
% - source_ind         = R x 1 (The set of elements that are allowed to contain source currents, a subset of brain_ind, by default equal to brain_ind)
% - additional_options = Struct, see below
%
% Fields of additional_options:
% -----------------------------
%
% - additional_options.direction_mode: Source directions; Values: 'mesh based' (default) or 'Cartesian' (optional).
%   Note: If Cartesian directions are used, the columns of the lead field matrix correspond
%   to directions x y z x y z x y z ..., respectively.
% - additional_options.precond: Preconditioner type; Values: 'cholinc' (Incomplete Cholesky, default) or 'ssor' (SSOR, optional)
% - additional_options.cholinc_tol: Tolerance of the Incomplete Cholesky; Values: Numeric (default is 0.001) or '0' (complete Cholesky)
% - additional_options.pcg_tol: Tolerance of the PCG iteration; Values: Numeric (default is 1e-6)
% - additional_options.maxit: Maximum number of PCG iteration steps; Values: Numeric (default is 3*floor(sqrt(N)))
% - additional_options.dipole_mode: Element-wise source direction mode; Values: '1' (direction of the dipole moment, default) or '2' (line segment between nodes 4 and 5 with the numbering given in Pursiainen et al 2011)
% - additional_options.permutation: Permutation of the linear system; Values: 'symamd' (default), 'symmmd' (optional), 'symrcm' (optional), or 'none' (optional)
%
% Output:
% -------
