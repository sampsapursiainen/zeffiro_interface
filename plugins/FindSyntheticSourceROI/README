Plugin to simulate an extended source patch consisting of all dipoles within a specified ROI.
Based on the FindSyntheticSourceLegacy plugin and requires this plugin for plotting dipoles.

Startup:  zef = zef_find_synthetic_source_ROI(zef)

One or several ROIs are placed at specified position(s). Dipoles within the ROI take specified orientation,
and specified amplitude divided by number of dipoles. Measurement data is calculated from all found dipoles 
and noise added to total measurement data.

Also contains functions to automatically select dipole orientations based on SVD or normal constraint.
--> example use cases:
	- Place a flat ROI along side a cortical wall using the normal orientation setting, 
		then set dipole orientations to normal to patch surface to simulate an extended cortical patch, 
		where all the dipoles have the same orientation
	- Place a flat ROI in radial direction, using min SVD on the MEG leadfield, set curvature >1,
		set dipole orientations to normal to patch surface to investigate cancelling effects on gyrus crowns
	- Place a spherical ROI around a real gyrus crown and set dipole orientations to normal to cortex,
		for the same scenario in a realistic headmodel
		

Possible ROI shape configurations:
- Spherical  
	Parameters:
		- radius
		
- Flat 
	Parameters:
		- radius
		- width (should be slightly >0, depending on source space resolution)
		- curvature 
			--> value between -1 and 1, where 0 is a flat plane
			--> increasing = the plane lies on the surface of a sphere with decreasing radius 
				(surface area stays the same)
			--> negative values = curved inwards
		- orientation
			--> user input, SVD based, or normal constrained
- Ellipsoid (Spheroid)
	Parameters:
		- radius 
		- width
		- orientation
			--> user input, SVD based, or normal constrained
	--> not much different from flat, but perhaps advantageous for comparison with GMM ellipsoids. 	
	

Dipoles within the ROI configurations:
- Orientation
	--> user input, SVD based, normal constrained or for flat and ellipsoid surface normal (for ellipsoid that
		means normal to the plane in which the ellipsoid lies, not the ellipsoid surface)
Plotting:
 --> Plot either the ROI or the dipoles within, for many dipoles this takes some time 

For several ROIs with same configurations (e.g. same radius), it suffices to specify the positions,
all other parameters will be repeated for all ROIs if only one value is given.

To invert orientation, use negative amplitudes.

For radius (and if applies, width) = 0, is equal to a single dipole.
