This is the newest installment of the GMM app. The version 2.0 includes new main app and two popup apps for various options.
For this version zeffiro_plugins.ini initialization line is:
GMModel, inverse_tools, GMM, GMModelApp_start

MAIN APP WINDOW SYNTAXING

In main app's window, you can mostly input one number per edit field but in the case of the first one "Maximum number of components",
you can give multiple maximum component number in the case of modeling time serie data. In that case possible syntaxes are
3,3,3,2
3;3;3;2
and
3 3 3 2

ADVANCED PLOT OPTIONS SYNTAXING

Pressing "Advanced plot options" from the main app, the Advanced GMM plot options appear.
From this window you can set component order to "Manually selected" when you get access to edit fields "Dipole components" and "Ellipsoid components".
The possible syntaxing for both of the fields are
3,1,2
3;1;2
and
3 1 2

Changing "Ellipsoid coloring" to "Manually selected", you can give your own array of colors for the plotted confidence ellipsoids.
Some of the possible syntaxings are
[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0.25,0.75]
[1,0,0];[0,1,0];[0,0.25,0.75]
'r','g',[0,0.25,0.75]
r,g,[0,0.25,0.75]
'r','g','b'
r,g,b
rgb

There might be other working syntaxes but we recommend to use one of the above to ensure the app works as expected.
