function outA = parcellateArray ( A, elementI, sourcesPerElement, kwargs )
%
% A = parcellateArray ( A, elementI, sourcesPerElement )
%
% This function reduces the size of a given array A by summing the
% contributions from all rows of A into a subset of the rows representing a set
% of active elements, determined by elementI. The  results are then normalized
% based on how many sources were placed into each of those active elements.
%
% Inputs:
%
% - A
%
%   The array computed for all possible source positions.
%
% - elementI
%
%   An index mapping rowI â†¦ eleI, where rowI is a row index of A and eleI is
%   the index of the active element that the contribution from that row should
%   map to.
%
% - sourcePerElement
%
%   Amounts by which each entry in elementI is divided or normalized by after
%   the aggregation.
%
% - kwargs.axis = 1
%
%   The axis along which the parcellation will be performed. Must be one of 1
%   (rows) or 2 (columns).
