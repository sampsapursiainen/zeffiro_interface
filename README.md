## Introduction

Zeffiro Interface (ZI) is an open source code package constituting an accessible tool for multidisciplinary finite element (FE) based forward and inverse simulations in complex geometries. Developed for MATLAB, ZI aims to streamline the process of analyzing brain activity and make it accessible to researchers and clinicians alike. With ZI, one can generate a volumetric finite element mesh for a realistic multilayer geometry, such as human brain or an asteroid.

A suitable surface segmentation can be produced, for example, using the FreeSurfer software suite (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) or Brainstorm (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/). ZI allows importing an anatomy to create an FE mesh distinguishing multiple different brain regions and, thereby, analysing cortical and sub-cortical structures as well as connectivity of the brain function over a time series. In each compartment, the orientation of the activity can be either normally constrained or unconstrained. The main routines of ZI can be accelerated significantly in a computer equipped with a graphics computing unit (GPU). It is recommendable to perform the forward simulation process, i.e., to generate the FE mesh and the lead field matrix utilizing a GPU.
